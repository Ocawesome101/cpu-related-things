This CPU is 8-bit with an 8-bit address bus, for a maximum of 256 bytes of memory. It has 4 general-purpose registers.

Instruction format:

  OPCODE  EXTEND  REGA    REGB
  3 bits  1 bit  2 bits  2 bits

If EXTEND is set, there is another 8 bit argument on the end.

OPCODEs, their mnemonics, and descriptions:
  000 - load
    EXTEND: ldi - LoaD Immediate; REGA = <extra 8 bit argument>
      else: ldr - LoaD Register;  REGA = REGB
  001 + EXTEND: store
  001 without EXTEND:
