Some circuit layouts.

General syntax:
  [input,input,...]=>C defines the inputs to a circuit C
  C=>[output] defines the outputs of a circuit C
  -> denotes a connection
  => denotes multiple connections
  Cˣ = x occurrences of circuit C
  Nₕ = high bits of N
  Nₗ = low bits of N
  Nₓ = N is x bits
  example:
    [I1₄,I2₈]=>C1->[O1]
      inputs I1 and I2 are passed to circuit C1, the output of which is
      assigned to O1.  I1 is 4 bits and I2 is 8.

    C1=>(C2=>C3ˣ)ʸ
      each output of C1 leads into an instance of C2, and each output of that
      leads into x instances of C3.

D = [I₄]=>#=>[16 outputs]
  4-bit decoder

M = [RW₁,V₈]=>#=>[O₈]
  single-byte memory cell.  if RW is 1 then writes, else reads

MC = [I₈,W₁,V₈]=>D[Iₕ]=>(D[Iₗ]=>M[W₁,V₁]¹⁶)¹⁶=>[OP₈]
  very simple memory addressing circuit.  if W₁ is provided, writes, else reads.  Address is I₈.
