FC-1
====

The FC-1 is a general-purpose 16-bit processor supporting 16MB of memory in its 24-bit address space.  It has a 2-ring hardware permissions model, a memory management unit, and a floating-point unit.

There are 8 general-purpose registers.  There are 8 "extended" registers for setting CPU attributes such as virtual memory boundaries, or where the stack is.

There is 1 24-bit memory bus.  There are 2 16-bit generic IO busses.  Events are primarily interrupt-driven.

Instruction Format:

   EXTEND
    ----|
OPCODE  | DEST SRC  VALUE (if EXTEND)
1111111 1 1111 1111 1111111111111111

If EXTEND is 1, then VALUE is present.
