// TCLL

TCLL is the Terrible C-Like Language.  It uses a somewhat C-like syntax and an entirely custom compiler written in Lua.  Currently it does no optimization.

I may implement a TCLL-to-Lua transpiler.  Or, perhaps, TCLL-to-C, since they're very similar.

The eventual goal is to get TCLL to the point where I can implement a TCLL compiler in TCLL.

A syntax highlighter for Vim is included in 'syntax/'.  Some code examples are included under 'examples/'.
